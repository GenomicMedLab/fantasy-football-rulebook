Team Manager Enrollment
=======================
Interested in joining the League as a :ref:`team-manager`? Read on for basic information
on League :ref:`eligibility`, :ref:`divisions`, and :ref:`application`.

.. _eligibility:

Eligibility
-----------
To join the League as a :ref:`team-manager`, you must be a member or affiliate of
the `Griffith`_ or `Wagner`_ laboratories. If you have any questions about eligibility,
please contact a :ref:`lm`.

.. _divisions:

League Divisions
----------------
The League will be sorted into two divisions to most ably group team managers in the same
work organizations (e.g. NCH and WUSTL) to the same division. If two team managers wish to
exchange divisions, requests may be made to a :ref:`lm` prior to the start of the regular
season.

.. _application:

Season Application
------------------
Due to limitations in the available NFL player pool, the League is limited to no more than
14 teams. A 1-week private enrollment period will be offered to :ref:`active-managers`
from the prior season, after which there will be open enrollment for the League subject to
:ref:`eligibility` constraints. Once the enrollment period closes, applicants will be
offered open positions on a first-come, first-served basis.

.. _active-managers:

Active Managers
###############
Fantasy Football is most fun when all managers actively participate throughout the season.
Managers that neglect their teams later in the season put teams that they played earlier
in the season at a disadvantage. For this reason, managers that regularly fail to field
competitive lineups are not offered private enrollment in the following season.
Particularly egregious or repeated neglect may also result in an eligibility ban in one or
more subsequent seasons.
