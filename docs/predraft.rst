League Pre-draft Competitions
=============================
For the draft to take place, an initial order of team managers must be decided. In our
league, we typically have a small competition ahead of the draft to determine draft order.
Details of the competition change year-to-year and are released after enrollment closes.

2022
----
The 2022 season followed the Federated Auto Parts 400 NASCAR race. Draft ordering was
determined by overall placement of selected drivers, with ties to be broken by number
of laps completed, and then by inverse round 1 placement. The final overall draft order was:

#. Wesley Goar
#. Susanna Kiwala
#. Malachi Griffith
#. Jason Saliba
#. Erica Barnell
#. Lee Trani
#. Alex Wagner
#. Nicholas Spies
#. Matthew Cannon
#. Zachary Skidmore
#. Obi Griffith
#. Robert Schuetz
#. Brian Li
#. Thomas Mooney

2021
----
The 2021 season followed the 2020 Olympic Men's Soccer competition (held in 2021 due to
COVID-19). Draft ordering was determined by the :ref:`olympic-soccer-rules`. Initial seed
for Olympic team selection was determined virtually by random draw. The final overall
rankings were:

#. Erica Barnell
#. Alex Wagner
#. Obi Griffith
#. Nick Spies
#. Robert Schutz
#. Jason Saliba
#. Kori Kuzma
#. Malachi Griffith
#. Zachary Skidmore
#. Brian Li
#. Lee Trani
#. Thomas Mooney
#. Susanna Kiwala
#. Matthew Cannon (joined after pre-draft)

League Pre-draft Rules
======================
As the competitions vary year-to-year, our rules for evaluating the outcome of those
competitions are specific to the type of event. These rulesets are described below.

Per league discussion, pre-draft competitions will have a consistent 3-phase structure:

1. An initial computer-randomized manager order is generated for the phase 2 competition.
2. Managers select representative competitors or teams from a real-world sporting event.
   Overall representative placement from this event determines manager order for phase 3.
3. Managers select their preferred position for the fantasy football draft in the order
   earned in the phase 2 competition.

Evaluation Rules for Olympic Soccer Competitions
------------------------------------------------

Olympic soccer takes place in several stages. The Group Stage involves two head-to-head
competitions with other teams from the same group of four teams. These groups are each
ranked, with the top two teams from each group advancing to the quarterfinals. Winners
at the quarterfinals advance to the semifinals. The two winning teams in the semifinals go
on to the finals for first (gold medal) and second (silver medal) place designation, and
the losing teams go on to a consolation match for third (bronze medal) and fourth place.

Since many teams get eliminated without a concrete ranking, the following rules are
applied to provide a deterministic rank outcome for the purpose of draft order.

Draft order selection is determined by the position or round the team achieved. The first
:ref:`team-manager` in the draft order will have selected the gold-medalist team from the
Olympic competition, with subsequent draft positions earned by managers fielding the
silver-medalist, bronze-medalist, and fourth-place Olympic teams.

Subsequent Team Manager rankings are determined by the stage in which their chosen
Olympic team was eliminated, with teams eliminated in the quarterfinals ranking higher
than teams eliminated in the group stage.

Ties among eliminated teams within a stage will be broken by the final rank of the
respective eliminating team. For example, in the quarterfinals South Korea is eliminated
by Mexico and Egypt is eliminated by Brazil. Brazil goes on to defeat Mexico in the
semifinals. The Team Manager selecting Egypt would have an earlier draft position than
the Team Manager selecting South Korea, as the team that eliminated Egypt (Brazil)
placed higher than the team eliminated South Korea (Mexico).

For teams that are eliminated in the group stage (where there are multiple contests), the
tie-breaking team is the top-ranking team in their group stage that they contested. In the
event that two Team Managers have teams eliminated in the same group and each has the same
designated tie-breaking team, their tie will be subsequently broken by their team's
overall rank in the group stage.
