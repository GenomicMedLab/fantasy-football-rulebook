League Basics
=============
Just getting started with fantasy football or the Griffith / Wagner league? Read on for
some basic background about the game and how it is played.

.. _fantasy-football:

Fantasy Football
----------------
Fantasy football is a game in which the participants manage a virtual professional American
football team. Fantasy points are awarded in weekly matchups based on the actual performances
of football players in real-world competition. [1]_

.. _team-manager:

Team Manager
------------
The competitors each take on the role of a Team Manager. At the beginning of the season,
the team managers must select their rosters by participating in a :ref:`draft <draft-rules>`
in which all relevant National Football League (NFL) players are available. Over the
course of the season, managers will trade players with other teams and replace members of
their team with unclaimed players. Every week managers must also select players on their
team to start for their team, with the remainder of their players "on the bench" and not
contributing to the virtual team score.

League Manager
--------------
The League Managers are responsible for managing league settings, events, and rules.
League Managers are expected to resolve participant disputes and correct errors that take
place over the course of the season. Our current league managers are Nick Spies and Alex
Wagner.

Our League
----------
Our league was founded in 2015 as a friendly annual competition among the members of the
Obi and Malachi Griffith Lab at Washington University in St. Louis. The 2015 season was held
on the Yahoo platform, with subsequent seasons on the ESPN platform. Traveling trophies were
added in the 2016 season for the lab champion (the "Golden Football") and last place (the
"Golden Toilet Seat"). The 2020 season saw the introduction of league divisions by popular
demand. Beginning with the 2021 season, the league expanded to include the laboratory of
:ref:`lm` Alex Wagner.

The competition has been held every year annually since its inception. Notable achievements
in the league history include:

* Obi Griffith receiving last place in the inaugural season
* Susanna Kiwala winning the championship in her rookie season
* Malachi Griffith as the first :ref:`team-manager` to have earned both a championship
  (2018) and last place (2020)

More champions and last-place finishers are recorded in our :ref:`league-history`.
