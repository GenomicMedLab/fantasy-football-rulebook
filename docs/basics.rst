Fantasy Football
----------------
Fantasy football is a game in which the participants serve as owner and :ref:`team-manager`
of virtual professional American football teams. The competitors select their rosters by
participating in a draft in which all relevant National Football League (NFL) players are
available. Fantasy points are awarded in weekly matchups based on the actual performances
of football players in real-world competition. [1]_

Our League
----------
The Griffith Gridiron League was founded in 2015 as a friendly annual competition among
the members of the Obi and Malachi Griffith Lab at Washington University in St. Louis.
The first season was held on Yahoo platform, with subsequent seasons on the ESPN platform.
Traveling trophies were added in the 2016 season for the lab champion (the "Golden Football")
and last place (the "Golden Toilet Seat"). The 2020-2021 season saw the introduction of
league divisions by popular demand.

Beginning with the 2021-2022 season, the league expanded to include the new laboratory
of :ref:`lm` and founder Alex Wagner at Nationwide Children's Hospital and the Ohio State
University.

The competition has been held every year annually since its inception. Notable achievements
in the league history include:
  * Obi Griffith receiving last place in the inaugural season
  * Susanna Kiwala winning the championship in her rookie season
  * Malachi Griffith as the first :ref:`team-manager` to have earned both a championship
    (2018) and last place (2020)

More champions and last-place finishers are recorded in our :ref:`league-history`.
