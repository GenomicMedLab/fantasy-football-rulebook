Additional Rules
================
In most instances, our league follows the intended play enabled by the ESPN application. In
cases where the behavior of the application is considered detrimental or unfair, we may
institute new rules which supercede the default behavior. These rules are always adopted
in the off-season. This section covers the additional rules that our league follows.

.. _additional-rule-sportsmanship:

1: Sportsmanship
----------------
This is a casual, low-stakes league. Please respect others' enjoyment of the game by
avoiding behaviors that may be considered unsportsmanlike. Unsportsmanlike behaviors
include but are not limited to losing games, trades, or waiver drops to alter the outcome
of the season for other teams.

Also be aware of your responsibilities to be an :ref:`Active Manager <active-managers>`.

Unsportsmanlike conduct will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the
:ref:`League Managers <lm>`.

.. _additional-rule-season-schedule:

2: Regular Season Schedule
--------------------------
The ESPN app provides an automatic scheduler which has historically produced uneven
team schedules. We override the automatic schedule so that every team plays each divisional
opponent twice, and evenly distributes other teams for the remainder of the season.

.. _additional-rule-playoff-schedule:

3: Playoff Schedule
-------------------
This league uses a 2-week single-elimination championship format. Following the regular
season, the top 2 teams from each division compete for the division championship, and
the bottom 2 teams from each division compete to avoid the division last place.

The winning teams from each divisional championship go on to compete for the league
championship, with the winner receiving the League Trophy (the "Golden Football").

The losing teams from each divisional championship go on to compete for the league
last place, with the loser receiving the Loser Trophy (the "Golden Toilet Seat").

Trophy recipients are expected to keep their trophies on public display at their
workstation until the conclusion of the following season.

4: Player Eligibility
---------------------
In the 2020-2021 season, Taysom Hill was made eligible by ESPN in week 11 for both the
Quarterback (QB) and Tight End (TE) position. The QB position is generally very
high-scoring, and the TE position is generally very low-scoring. This disparity allowed
many teams to start Hill in the TE slot, and his solid QB performance (24 points) translated
into an easy TE1 status that week. To put this in perspective, the overall #1 tight end Travis
Kelce scored an average of 14 points / game in 2020.

To prevent such misaligned eligibility assignments from impacting future games, we have
categorized players into 3 tiers:
Tier 1: QB
Tier 2: RB/WR
Tier 3: TE/K

If a player is made eligible for positions in more than 1 tier by ESPN, they may only be
used for the highest-tier slot(s) for which they are eligible. Here are some example
scenarios illustrating the use of this rule:

* A player with both QB (Tier 1) and TE (Tier 3) eligibility may be started in the QB
  slot, but not the TE slot.
* A player with RB (Tier 2) and WR (Tier 2) eligibility may be started in either an RB or
  WR slot.
* A player with RB (Tier 2), WR (Tier 2), and TE (Tier 3) eligibility may be started in
  either an RB or WR slot, but not the TE slot.

Teams that start a multi-tier eligible player in a lower-tier slot will have the points
scored by that player deducted from their team score at the end of the week.
