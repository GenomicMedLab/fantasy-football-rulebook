Additional Rules
================
In most instances, our league follows the intended play enabled by the ESPN application. In
cases where the behavior of the application is considered detrimental to enjoyment of the
game, we may institute new rules which supercede the default behavior. These rules are
always discussed and adopted in the off-season. This section covers the additional rules
that our league follows.

.. _additional-rule-sportsmanship:

1: Sportsmanship
----------------
This is a casual, low-stakes league. Please respect others' enjoyment of the game by
avoiding unsportsmanlike conduct. Unsportsmanlike conduct includes but is not limited to
intentionally losing games, trades, or waiver drops to alter the outcome of the season
for other teams. Also see this `guide to common fantasy football etiquette`_.

Also be aware of your responsibility to be an :ref:`Active Manager <active-managers>`.

Unsportsmanlike conduct will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis by the
:ref:`League Managers <lm>`.

.. _additional_rule_eligibility:

2: Player Eligibility
---------------------
In the 2020-2021 season, Taysom Hill was made eligible by ESPN in week 11 for both the
Quarterback (QB) and Tight End (TE) position. The QB position is generally very
high-scoring, and the TE position is generally very low-scoring. This disparity allowed
many teams to start Hill in the TE slot, and his solid QB performance (24 points) translated
into a clear TE1 status that week. To put this in perspective, the overall #1 tight end in
2020 (Travis Kelce) scored an average of 14 points / game that season.

To prevent such misaligned eligibility assignments from impacting future games, we have
categorized players into 3 tiers:
Tier 1: QB
Tier 2: RB/WR
Tier 3: TE/K

If a player is made eligible for positions in more than 1 tier by ESPN, they may only be
used for the highest-tier slot(s) for which they are eligible. Here are some example
scenarios illustrating the use of this rule:

* A player with both QB (Tier 1) and TE (Tier 3) eligibility may be started in the QB
  slot, but not the TE slot.
* A player with RB (Tier 2) and WR (Tier 2) eligibility may be started in either an RB or
  WR slot.
* A player with RB (Tier 2), WR (Tier 2), and TE (Tier 3) eligibility may be started in
  either an RB or WR slot, but not the TE slot.

Teams that start a multi-tier eligible player in a lower-tier slot will have the points
scored by that player deducted from their team score at the end of the week.
