Scoring settings
----------------
Our league is a 0.5 Point-Per-Reception (PPR) league, which provides an additional half
point to a player for each reception made. This format provides some additional value to
receivers and tends to score higher than "standard" leagues that do not provide points per
reception. We otherwise follow standard ESPN scoring settings. Current season settings can
be found on the `league scoring settings page`_.
