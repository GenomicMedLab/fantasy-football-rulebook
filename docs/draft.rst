Team settings
-------------
Our team size follows ESPN standards, starting 1 Quarterback (QB), 2 Running Back (RB),
2 Wide Receiver (WR), 1 Tight End (TE), 1 :ref:`flex`, 1 Kicker, and 1 Defense/Special Teams.
Benches have an additional 7 players that may swap into these starting slots prior to
individual game start. Our league also allows 1 additional bench slot for a player with an
:ref:`ir` (IR) designation.

.. _flex:

Flex Position
#############
A flex position allows a team to start a player with one of several designations. Our
league uses the ESPN standard configuration for a flex, which can hold a player with any
of a Running Back (RB), Wide Receiver (WR), or Tight End (TE) designation.

Scoring settings
----------------
Our league uses a 0.5 Point-Per-Reception (PPR) format, which provides an additional half
point to players for each reception made. This format provides some additional value to
receivers and results in higher scores than "standard" leagues that do not use PPR. We
otherwise follow standard ESPN scoring settings. Current season settings can
be found on the `league settings page`_.
