The Draft
=========
A good draft performance is one of the most important components to a successful fantasy
football season. It is important for any player to familiarize themselves with what the
draft is and how it works. This page provides some basic information on the specifics of
our league draft.

.. _draft-rules:

Rules of the Draft
------------------
The draft is typically held 1-2 weeks before the start of the NFL regular season, to
minimize the chances that a team drafts an NFL player that gets injured between the time
of the draft and the first game. The draft is held live and typically lasts between 1-2
hours. Each team manager selects 1 NFL player from the available player pool in each round
of the draft. Our league uses a `snake draft`_ format, where the selection order reverses
each round; i.e. if a team manager selects first in round 1, they will select last in
round 2.

Team managers have a short amount of time each round to make their selection. Failing to
make a selection in the allotted time will result in an auto-draft selection, based on
the manager's autopick draft strategy. A manager's autopick strategy may be revised at any
time ahead of the draft by `following the autopick directions`_.

Team Settings

Our team size follows ESPN standards, starting 1 Quarterback (QB), 2 Running Back (RB),
2 Wide Receiver (WR), 1 Tight End (TE), 1 :ref:`flex`, 1 Kicker, and 1 Defense/Special Teams.
Benches have an additional 7 players that may swap into these starting slots prior to
individual game start. Our league also allows 1 additional bench slot for a player with an
:ref:`ir` (IR) designation.

.. _flex:

Flex Position
#############
A flex position allows a team to start a player with one of several designations. Our
league uses the ESPN standard configuration for a flex, which can hold a player with any
of a Running Back (RB), Wide Receiver (WR), or Tight End (TE) designation.

Scoring Settings
----------------
Our league uses a 0.5 Point-Per-Reception (PPR) format, which provides an additional half
point to players for each reception made. This format provides some additional value to
receivers and results in higher scores than "standard" leagues that do not use PPR. We
otherwise follow standard ESPN scoring settings. Current season settings can
be found on the `league settings page`_.
