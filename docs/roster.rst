Roster Management
=================
This page provides the rules for managing team rosters following :ref:`the-draft`.

Setting a Lineup
----------------
Players become locked in their set position on a team roster at the time of kickoff.
Be sure to see Additional Rule :ref:`additional_rule_eligibility` regarding players
with multiple role designations.

More information about how to change your roster can be found `here <https://support.espn.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003847311-Setting-Your-Lineup>`_.

Waiver Wire
-----------
There are no restrictions on the number of players that may be acquired via waivers.
Waiver priority is reset each week in the inverse order of standings. Dropped players
have a 1-day waiver period.

More information about how to use waivers can be found `here <https://support.espn.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000036711-Claim-a-Player-Off-Waivers>`_.

Trades

Accepted trades are processed immediately without review. Concerns of collusion or other
:ref:`unsportsmanlike conduct <additional-rule-sportsmanship>` should be brought to the
attention of a :ref:`lm`.
