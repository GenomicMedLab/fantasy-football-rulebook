Season Schedule
===============
The fantasy football season schedule has two phases: the :ref:`regular-season` and the
:ref:`playoffs`. Regular season and playoff schedules are both influenced by
:ref:`divisions`.

.. _regular-season:

Regular Season
--------------
.. warning::
   Prior to 2021, the regular NFL season would last for 17 weeks, with each team playing 16
   games in that span. As of 2021, the NFL has extended this to 18 weeks and 17 games.

   The change to the NFL schedule requires us to decide how to revise our league
   schedule to accommodate the extra game. This will be discussed by league participants for
   the 2021 season ahead of the season start.

Our league plays a 14-week regular season, beginning with the first NFL regular season
game.

The ESPN app provides an automatic scheduler which has historically produced uneven
team schedules. We override the automatic schedule so that every team plays each divisional
opponent twice, and evenly distributes other teams for the remainder of the season.

.. _playoffs:

Playoffs
--------
.. warning::
   Revision of the below playoff structure is under consideration for the 2021 season.

This league uses a 2-week single-elimination championship format. Following the regular
season, the top 2 teams from each division compete for the division championship, and
the bottom 2 teams from each division compete to avoid the division last place.

The winning teams from each divisional championship go on to compete for the league
championship, with the winner receiving the League Trophy (the "Golden Football").

The losing teams from each divisional championship go on to compete for the league
last place, with the loser receiving the Loser Trophy (the "Golden Toilet Seat").

Trophy recipients are expected to keep their trophies on public display at their
workstation until the conclusion of the following season.
